TODO:

Code review:
  2) The gui#finalize needs documentation.
  3) Just go over the code for code smells.
  4) Review README

Slots did not clear on a system crash... double check it as I thought I had this covered.
  This is very rare unlikely conditions where this can happen.
  Can't think of a fix.

OLD:

# Missing #
  Gdk::Event::BUTTON_PRESS_MASK
  Gdk::Selection::CLIPBOARD
  Gdk::Selection::PRIMARY

YAML security?  Check for ruby! in YAML?

DONE:

  1) Deprecate :append_menu_item and stuff, use :add_menu_item  instead.
    "append" was confusing.  :into sets the add method to use.
    Correct semantic is "add"... using :add_menu_item.

  5) Review @program.release:
    Verbose complain that @program was not initilizing. Fixed.
