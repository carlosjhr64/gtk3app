TODO:

* The gui#finalize needs documentation.
* Review README

DONE:

* Deprecate :append_menu_item and stuff, use :add_menu_item  instead.
    "append" was confusing.  :into sets the add method to use.
    Correct semantic is "add"... using :add_menu_item.

* Review @program.release:
    Verbose complain that @program was not initilizing. Fixed.
